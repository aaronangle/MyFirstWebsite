                <p class="grayText">My name is Aaron Angle. I am 21 years old and am currently living in Gilbert, Arizona. I love to read, hike, and play basketball. I enjoy coaching basketball and helping others in any way that I can. I also love to spend time with my family and friends. One of my favorite things to do is to learn something new and practice until I develop the new skill. Another one of my passions is web development and computer programming. I recently attended Eastern Arizona College where I dabbled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C#. I am currently attendind The University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp for Web Development, where I hope to become fluent in a number of programming languages.</p>
                <p>Previously, I worked for a small construction crew while attending school. While I was there I learned the value of hard work and how to work with a team to accomplish something big. Often times two or three workers, along with myself, would be tasked with finishing large remodels or entirley new builds all by ourselves. I was also often tasked with finishing entire smaller projects by myself with no to supervise me. I learned how to be accountable and work hard, even when I was not being constantly watched.</p>
                <p>On this website I will be providing some of the work that I have produced as a web developer in the portfolio section. I will also include a way to submit your contact information, in case you are interested in contacting me.</p>
