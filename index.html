                        <p class="grayText margin">My name is Aaron Angle. I am 21 years old and am currently living in
                            Gilbert, Arizona. I love to read, hike, and play basketball. I enjoy coaching basketball and
                            helping others in any way that I can. I also love to spend time with my family and friends.
                            One
                            of my favorite things to do is to learn something new and practice until I develop the new
                            skill. Another one of my passions is web development and computer programming. I recently
                            attended Eastern Arizona College where I dabbled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C#. I am
                            currently attendind The University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp for Web Development, where I
                            hope
                            to become fluent in a number of programming languages.</p>
                        <p class="grayText margin">Previously, I worked for a small construction crew while attending
                            school. While I was there I learned the value of hard work and how to work with a team to
                            accomplish something big. Often times two or three workers, along with myself, would be
                            tasked
                            with finishing large remodels or entirley new builds all by ourselves. I was also often
                            tasked
                            with finishing entire smaller projects by myself with no to supervise me. I learned how to
                            be
                            accountable and work hard, even when I was not being constantly watched.</p>
                        <p class="grayText space4 margin">On this website I will be providing some of the work that I have
                            produced
                            as a web developer in the portfolio section. I will also include a way to submit your
                            contact
                            information, in case you are interested in contacting me.</p>
